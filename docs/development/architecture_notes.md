# MonitorPy Architecture Notes

## API and Database Integration Strategy

### Database Strategy

The MonitorPy application should implement a flexible database approach:

1. **Optional Database Architecture**:
   - Core monitoring functionality works without a database
   - Historical storage and trending available when a database is configured
   - Support multiple database types:
     - SQLite for simple deployments (default)
     - PostgreSQL/MySQL for production environments
   - Database configuration through environment variables or config file

2. **Database Implementation Details**:
   - Store monitoring results with timestamps for historical analysis
   - Track trends and performance metrics over time
   - Enable alerting based on historical patterns
   - Implement data retention policies for long-term storage management

### API Integration

MonitorPy should implement a REST API as the primary integration point:

1. **API-First Design**:
   - Create a comprehensive REST API for all MonitorPy operations
   - Make the API the only integration point for external systems
   - Support JSON for all requests and responses
   - Include authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Implement pagination, filtering, and search capabilities

2. **Integration Patterns**:
   - **Independent Systems**: MonitorPy runs as a standalone service
   - **API Integration**: External systems connect solely through API
   - **Direct DB Read**: Allow read-only access to database for specific use cases
   - **Event-Based**: Support message queue integration for notifications

3. **Laravel Integration**:
   - Laravel application connects to MonitorPy via API
   - No shared database schema dependencies
   - Keep systems decoupled for maximum flexibility
   - Consider using a message queue for asynchronous notifications

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core API Development
1. Create Flask API wrapper around monitoring functionality
2. Implement SQLite database integration
3. Add basic authentication for API access
4. Create Docker setup for development environment

### Phase 2: Database Flexibility
1. Add support for PostgreSQL and MySQL
2. Implement database configuration options
3. Create migration tools for database schema changes
4. Add data retention functionality

### Phase 3: Integration Examples
1. Develop Laravel client library/example
2. Create simple dashboard frontend
3. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
4. Document integration patterns for various frameworks

## Docker Development Environment

For local development, create a Docker Compose setup with:

1. MonitorPy API service
2. Database service (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
3. Simple web UI for demonstration
4. Network configuration for service communication

The environment should be configurable to work alongside Laravel Sail when needed but function independently for standalone development and testing.
