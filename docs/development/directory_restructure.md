# Directory Structure Restructuring (Completed)

## Previous Structure Issue (Resolved)

The previous nested directory structure (`monitorpy/monitorpy/`) was causing import problems:

```
monitorpy/
├── monitorpy/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── api/
│   ├── cli.py
│   ├── core/
│   ├── plugins/
│   └── utils/
├── monitorpy.egg-info/
├── setup.py
└── tests/
```

This structure:
- Causes confusion with imports (`monitorpy.monitorpy.module` vs `monitorpy.module`)
- Requires special handling in scripts and test code
- Makes development environment setup more complicated
- Is not following standard Python package conventions

## New Structure (Implemented)

We have restructured the project to follow standard Python package conventions:

```
monitorpy/
├── __init__.py
├── api/
├── cli.py
├── core/
├── plugins/
└── utils/
tests/
setup.py
```

This structure:
- Uses a single level for the main package
- Moves tests outside the package
- Follows standard Python package conventions
- Simplifies imports (`monitorpy.module`)

## Implementation (Completed)

The directory restructuring has been successfully completed following these steps:

1. A temporary branch (`restructure-directories`) was created
2. Files were moved to the new structure
3. Imports were updated in all Python files (from `monitorpy.monitorpy.X` to `monitorpy.X`)
4. The setup.py file was updated to point to the new package structure
5. Tests were updated with correct import paths
6. The new structure was tested to ensure everything worked correctly
7. The changes were committed and merged into the main branch

All code now uses the new import paths and the package works correctly with the new structure.

## Migration Actions

1. **Breaking Changes**:
   - External code that imported from `monitorpy.monitorpy` needs to update imports
   - Documentation has been updated to reflect new import paths

2. **Version Bump**:
   - A version bump to 0.2.0 indicates this structural change

3. **Documentation**:
   - All examples and documentation now use the new import style

4. **Installation Verification**:
   - Package installation works correctly in both development mode and via pip
   - All command-line tools continue to work with the new structure

## Migration Guide for Users

For users of the library, provide a migration guide:

```
# Migration Guide for MonitorPy 0.2.0

MonitorPy 0.2.0 restructures the package to follow standard conventions.
This requires updating your imports:

## Old imports:
from monitorpy.monitorpy.core import MonitorPlugin
from monitorpy.monitorpy.plugins import WebsiteStatusPlugin

## New imports:
from monitorpy.core import MonitorPlugin
from monitorpy.plugins import WebsiteStatusPlugin

All functionality remains the same, only the import paths have changed.
