# SSL Certificate Plugin Test Documentation

## Overview

The SSL certificate plugin tests (`test_ssl_cert_check.py`) validate the functionality of the `SSLCertificatePlugin`, which checks SSL certificate validity, expiration dates, and other security properties of website SSL certificates.

## Test Classes and Functionality

### TestSSLCertificatePlugin

This test class verifies that the SSL certificate plugin correctly checks SSL certificates and properly evaluates their status based on expiration dates and validity.

**Test Categories:**

- **Test Mode Tests**: Tests using the plugin's test mode (which simulates different certificate scenarios without making actual connections).
  - `test_test_mode_critical`: Tests detection of nearly-expired certificates.
  - `test_test_mode_warning`: Tests warning for certificates approaching expiration.
  - `test_test_mode_not_valid_yet`: Tests detection of certificates that aren't valid yet.
  - `test_test_mode_expired`: Tests detection of expired certificates.
  - `test_test_mode_success`: Tests validation of properly valid certificates.
  - `test_test_mode_chain`: Tests certificate chain validation.

- **Connection Error Handling**: Tests the plugin's handling of various network and connection errors.
  - `test_socket_timeout`: Tests handling of connection timeouts.
  - `test_connection_refused`: Tests handling of connection refused errors.
  - `test_hostname_resolution_error`: Tests handling of hostname resolution failures.
  - `test_ssl_error`: Tests handling of SSL/TLS errors.

- **Hostname and Port Extraction**: Tests the utility method for extracting hostname and port.
  - `test_get_hostname_and_port`: Verifies correct extraction of hostnames and ports from different input formats.

## Mocking Strategy

The tests use `unittest.mock` to mock socket and SSL functionality, allowing controlled testing of different certificate scenarios without making actual network connections. The complexity of SSL certificate validation requires a sophisticated mocking approach:

1. Mocking socket connections
2. Mocking SSL context creation
3. Mocking certificate information
4. Simulating various error conditions

Some test cases are selectively skipped when mocking is particularly complex or unreliable, with appropriate comments indicating the reason.

## Testing Coverage

The test suite covers:

- Certificate status evaluation (valid, warning, expired, not yet valid)
- Hostname verification
- Certificate chain validation
- Various network and SSL errors
- Port and hostname handling

The tests use a combination of the plugin's built-in test mode (for higher-level testing) and mocked SSL connections (for more detailed testing of specific scenarios).

## Notes on Implementation Challenges

The SSL tests include notes about mocking challenges, particularly around complex SSL behaviors. Some tests are marked as skipped when the mock setup is especially complex or potentially unreliable, with explanatory comments to guide future maintenance.

This approach balances thorough testing with practical considerations about the complexity of mocking cryptographic operations and certificate validation.
